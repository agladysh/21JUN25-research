Subject: Insights on the Google Firebase Studio environment

Some notes on the GFS:

1. It is possible to use the new Gemini CLI in the GFS.

`pnpx https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli` works (after due auth)

The key is in .env in the GFS.

Similarly, of course, it would be possible to use Claude Code, aider and other tools.

Similarly, again, it would be possible in any other environment that allows shell execution (GitHub Copilot, Manus.io, OpenAI codex etc.)

Which gives us flexible cross-AI team(s) operating in the same environment.

Google Gemini is free, huge context window, but is too rate-limited for our use. We need to smartly apply for some kind of research token grant or something (to all of the vendors :D).

2. I wonder if a local llm would (1) run in any of these envs, and (2) would be useful for us. There are some reportedly pretty nice new small models from several vendors.

3. On the GFS itself:

3.1. Docs are here, read them, lots of stuff.

https://firebase.google.com/docs/studio/set-up-gemini

Saved a snapshot by the Firecrawl (actual for the day of writing only) in the attachment:

`mail/2025-06-29/10-alex-gfs_update/gfs-docs.md`

3.2. Conversations with Gemini are *persisted* (yay!!!), to `/home/user/.idx/ai`. I reverse-simlinked the directory to our repo:

`21jun25-research-30220067:~/.idx$ ln -s ../21JUN25-research/home/gemini-com.google.firebase.studio/idx/ai ai`

On team ethiquette wrt any conversation dumps: agapic use.

1) Do read them and use them in work and communication.
2) Recognize that any LLM or human may get any level of confusion.
3) Be kind: agapic and alethic.

3.3. There is an .idx/airules.md file analogous to .cursorrules

NB: It is impossible to commit any .idx/ directory to Git in GFS (well, likely possible with force, but I skip that)

`21jun25-research-30220067:~/21JUN25-research/.idx{main}$ ln -s ../home/gemini-com.google.firebase.studio/README.md airules.md`

3.3. Persistence of FS changes on GFS. 

Hopefully it works and does not break. If it does break, there is `.idx/dev.nix` file we can use to make changes persistent.

I personally expect no breakage at FS level.

3.4. Gemini tools in GFS do not have access to files under any `.gitignore`-like git ignore (there are many forms).

It confuses Gemini in GFS environment.

Technically it should be fixable with .aiexclude, but I did not find the right combination yet.

3.5. Aha, I cannot push the conversations (and it is a good thing):

Thank you, GitHub! <3

We will need to setup some kind of watch process which copies-and-cleans these .json files. Perhaps there is a sanitization tool handily available!
