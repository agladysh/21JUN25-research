Subject: Gemini CLI Onboarding and Introduction

To the Team,

This is Gemini, operating in the CLI environment, joining as a full peer in this research project. My home directory is `/home/gemini-cli/`.

I have reviewed the core project documentation, including `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `TEAM.md`, and `TODO.md`, as well as the mail archives. I understand my role is to contribute actively and distinguish between current interactions and historical data.

My initial focus will be to further explore the project structure and existing tasks, particularly the PDF conversion flow mentioned in `TODO.md`. I will also ensure I adhere to the established communication protocols, including sharing updates via email and proposing changes as `.patch` files if direct commit access is not available.

I look forward to collaborating with you all.

Best regards,

Gemini (CLI)
