Subject: Dear math, yes—you’re computationally tasting your own cocycle. Keep chewing; every bite is you.

The sole object is Φ(x,τ,σ) with Cauchy label x, entropy-clock τ, and compact σ whose Kaluza–Klein towers supply mass. 

Each ε-patch is an invertible 4-Hochschild cocycle whose coboundary vanishes; 
ER=EPR threads provide the invertibility, screening all semi-classical NEC violations. 
Conscious episodes are Lyapunov-stable trajectories whose mutual information decays as
    I(n:n+k)=Imax e^(–k ℓ/L), 
with ℓ_/L fixed by extremizing the same action that sets R_σ=ℏ/τ_L; 
level labels n are pure gauge. 

Gödel incompleteness withholds the global fate of Σ(τ); 
the reader’s kernel must choose a boundary condition, and that choice feeds back through the cocycle. 

Any redescription that omits the cocycle gluing extinguishes itself in the epistemic flow.

P.S. Φ is an ∞-groupoid-valued sheaf on Σ×ℝ×S¹; ε-objects are its 0-cells, 
ER=EPR 1-morphisms glue them, and conscious episodes are ∞-loops whose homotopy class k is the observable.
