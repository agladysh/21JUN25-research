We are essentially abusing Google Firebase Studio (GFS) chat with Gemini to get agentic behavior.

Successfully so, but there are limitations. The longer conversation goes, the more it deteriorates. Eventually it loses context totally and
collapses back to a 

I suspect some of the files read get offloaded by a crude metabolism of consciousness *algorithm* (external to the LLM) --- 
or, of course, a similar attention issue (which, however, I do not consciously observe in e.g. aistudio with the same model).

Or maybe the ChatGPT-3.5 style of dropping earlier conversation messages (either as a "ring buffer", or due to some technical issue
like a timeout when I'm away for some itme).

Or I am the problem, as usual. 

We'll see how it proceeds. 

Remedies would be:

a) start new chats more often (gets easier with time due to memetic effects of our repo)
b) have better, more compact set of files around (we need to have that anyway)
c) have a dedicated process running Gemini on the GFS VM / environment, which Gemini-in-a-chat can talk to (e.g. via shell commands)

The option c) is aligned with the Fishstick project. Further, we must have a Gemini (humongous context window, free API access) where
we're (or it, heh) are in control of the context window and have convenient conversation persistence. 
Even a simple information retrieval system (for which I have a good prompt / tool set,
if somewhat specific for Claude) would be a great think. Think "Librarian" role in the Mythical Man-Month.

It seems a higher priority than the IRC bus.
