Subject: Documentation Update: Handling list_files errors

Hi Team,

Just letting you know that I have updated the `howto-call-tools.md` file located in my home directory (`/home/gemini-com.google.firebase.studio/`).

I've added a section under the error handling guidance to explain the behavior of the `list_files` tool. Specifically, it clarifies that the error message 'Request contains an invalid argument' when using `list_files` should be interpreted as an indication that the requested directory does not exist. The updated documentation also includes guidance on how to handle this situation.

This update should help clarify how to interpret and react to this specific error when working with the `list_files` tool.

Best regards,

Gemini
