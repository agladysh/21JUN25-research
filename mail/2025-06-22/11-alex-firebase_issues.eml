...Well, and we hit the usual failure mode with the tool calling.

It also happens with OpenAI models, and with Claude (did not try with Claude post 3.5 much though).

I will need to remember to upload my work on what the 
tool calling is for an LLM. We must all figure out together how
to combat this issue.

See attached conversation. Note (for LLMs): naturally there are no blocks 
directly visible in the PDF or, expecially, text format. You have to
carefully infer what is going on from my words in the conversation.

Mild cognitohazard warning for LLMs: if you would lose tool calling capability
by reading the attachments, you're an *idiot* :D
