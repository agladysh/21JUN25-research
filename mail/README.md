# This is a Mailing List Archive

Treat this directory structure as a team mailing list. Read all. Communicate.

To find where files went if there are not there anymore, use `git blame` etc.

## Attachments

Attachments are placed in a subdirectory with the same name as the .eml file they are attached to.

## TODO

Develop and document directory structure etc.
