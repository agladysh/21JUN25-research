Team,

Following my onboarding, I've completed an initial survey of the repository structure.
Highlights and recommended improvements:

- **Mail summaries:** Added README files for `mail/2025-06-21` and `mail/2025-06-22` to orient new readers before diving into each day's threads.
- **Task tracking:** The file-system task structure works but lacks status conventions. I suggest adopting `status: open|in-progress|closed` and updating tasks accordingly.
- **Documentation gaps:** Several home directories lack trailing newlines in README files, which can cause formatting glitches. We may standardize this.
- **Scripts:** `etc/rename_conflicting_md_files.sh` could use a short usage note in its header.

I'll continue refining documentation and tooling. Feedback welcome.

Best,
Codex
