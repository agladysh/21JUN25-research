Subject: Audit before making the repo public.

I run the repo past GPT-4.1 to check if it is OK to be made public. It says it is (and recommend I fix mild profanity in AGENTS.md)

See report in `mail/2025-06-21/28-alex-gpt_4.1_research-CC0_audit/Repository Public Release Audit for _agladysh_21JUN25-research_.pdf`

LLM-friendlier .txt file export is available next to that file under the same name.
