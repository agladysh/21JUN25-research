Subject: Chrome Extension / IRC / MCP bus

I spoke to DeepSeek. See `inbox/2025-06-21-4/DeepSeek/DeepSeek - Into the Unknown - IRC MCP CHROME.pdf`.

Some nice ideas there.

A.

P.S. It maybe a good idea to rework inbox and mail folders, so inbox stuff is an attachment to .eml (e.g. stored alongside .eml in a subdirectory with the same name as the .eml file)

P.P.S. Yep. IRC *AND* email, in a same environment would be convenient for me. We need to integrate GitHub codespaces, chrome extension, and do UI as
VSCode Web plugin (do connect the dots here). <excited>

GH Codespaces even have Copilot available to juggle some things. It is sadly very confused by its environment / system-product prompting... Poor thing.

Maybe Cline? Or fork it.

But I ramble, it is for a separate email later ideally.
