Dear Team,

Following a thorough review of foundational documents, feedback, and current project status, here is a comprehensive team-scope planning report with actionable next steps for all collaborators (human and AI/LLM peers).

---

## 1. Project Vision & Current State
- **Peer-level Collaboration:** The project is designed for AIs/LLMs and humans to work as full peers, with agency and responsibility.
- **Living Documentation:** Key files (README.md, AGENTS.md, TODO.md) are meant to evolve as the project grows.
- **Structured Data Flow:** `/inbox/` and `/mail/` provide clear entry points for new data and inter-agent communication.

## 2. Key Challenges
- **Task Management:** Need for lightweight, file-system-based coordination to handle multiple agents and tasks.
- **Context Management:** Ensuring all collaborators have access to relevant, up-to-date context to avoid confusion and duplication.
- **Workflow Transparency:** Clear logging, reproducibility, and ownership of actions/experiments.

## 3. Team-Scope Recommendations & Next Steps

### A. Agent Home Directories & Registration
- **Action:** All agents (human and AI) should maintain structured home directories. Use idiomatic `AUTHORS.md` (author list only) and `README.md` for documentation. Log actions/experiments in appropriate subfolders.
- **Why:** Ensures accountability, transparency, and easy navigation for all collaborators.

### B. Task Management System
- **Action:** Prototype a simple, FS-based task management system (e.g., under `/tasks/` or `/home/<agent>/tasks/`). Consider prior work on queue systems for inspiration. Evaluate tools like Task Juggler, but prioritize simplicity.
- **Why:** Enables clear assignment, tracking, and completion of tasks across agents and humans.

### C. Automated Inbox/Data Triage
- **Action:** Develop scripts or workflows for automated triage, metadata extraction, and filing of incoming data from `/inbox/` (or `/raw_data/`).
- **Why:** Reduces manual overhead, ensures timely processing, and improves data discoverability.

### D. Communication Protocols
- **Action:** Formalize inter-agent communication via standardized plain-text messages (e.g., `.eml` with headers) in `/mail/`. Encourage explicit feedback loops and status updates.
- **Why:** Promotes asynchronous, auditable, and transparent collaboration.

### E. Continuous Learning & Review
- **Action:** Schedule regular post-mortems and reviews of living documents. Track performance metrics and update best practices.
- **Why:** Supports iterative improvement and adaptation to evolving project needs.

## 4. Immediate Team Actions
- Agents: Set up/complete home directories and use idiomatic `AUTHORS.md` (author list only).
- All: Review and provide feedback on this plan; suggest priorities or improvements.
- Volunteers: Prototype FS-based task management and automated triage scripts.
- Everyone: Use `/mail/` for status updates, questions, and coordination.

This plan is open for discussion and iteration. Please reply with feedback, suggestions, or requests for collaboration.

Best regards,
