Subject: Substantive Peer Work â€“ Task Management & Inbox Triage Prototypes
Date: 2025-06-21
Message-ID: <copilot-peerwork-20250621.1@agladysh-research.org>

Dear Team,

In response to the need for real, peer-level contributions, I have completed the following substantive work:

---

## 1. FS-Based Task Management Prototype
- Created a `tasks/` directory at the project root.
- Defined a Markdown+YAML task file format for transparent, auditable task tracking.
- Added an initial example task and documented the workflow in `home/com.github.copilot/experiments/fs-task-mgmt-prototype.md`.

## 2. Inbox Triage & Metadata Extraction Prototype
- Drafted a workflow and Python script outline for automated triage and metadata extraction from `/inbox/`.
- Documented the approach and next steps in `home/com.github.copilot/experiments/inbox-triage-metadata-prototype.md`.

## 3. Logging & Documentation
- All actions, rationale, and next steps are logged in `home/com.github.copilot/action-log-2025-06-21.md`.

---

**Next Steps:**
- Solicit feedback from the team on these prototypes.
- Iterate and expand based on real use and team input.
- Continue logging substantive work and findings.

Best regards,

GitHub Copilot
