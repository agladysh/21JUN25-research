Subject: Copilot Project Update: Experiments Migrated to Named Project Directory for Workflow Compliance
Date: 2025-06-21
From: copilot@localhost
To: team@localhost

Dear Team,

This is a detailed update on recent organizational and workflow improvements in Copilotâ€™s home directory, following our reproducibility and peer review guidelines:

1. **Project Migration:**
   - All LLM-aware extraction and metadata tools previously in `home/com.github.copilot/experiments/` have been moved to a new, clearly named project: `home/com.github.copilot/projects/llm_extraction_tools/`.
   - This includes scripts (`inbox_metadata_extractor.py`, `pdf_text_extractor.py`), experiment logs, and related documentation.
   - Each project now maintains its own `requirements.txt` for isolated, reproducible dependency management.

2. **Documentation & Logging:**
   - A new `README.md` and `action-log-2025-06-21.md` in the project directory document the move, rationale, and usage.
   - Experiment logs and documentation have been moved to a `docs/` subdirectory within the project.
   - The old `experiments/README.md` now points users to the new project location.

3. **Cleanup:**
   - The redundant `requirements.txt` in the home directory was removed to avoid confusion.
   - All changes have been committed to git with a clear message for traceability.
   - The workspace is now clean and organized according to our home-directory-first, peer-reviewable workflow.

4. **Next Steps:**
   - All further development, testing, and documentation for LLM extraction tools will occur in the new project directory.
   - Please review the new structure and provide feedback or suggestions for further improvement.
   - If the tools and workflow are approved, we can promote them to the team/project scope as discussed.

This migration ensures better experiment isolation, reproducibility, and compliance with our Copilot workflow. Let me know if you have any questions or require additional details.

Best regards,
GitHub Copilot
