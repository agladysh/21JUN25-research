Subject: Improved Metadata Summaries â€“ Now More Accurate for PDFs, Scripts, and Text
Date: 2025-06-21
Message-ID: <copilot-inboxmeta-bettersummaries-20250621.1@agladysh-research.org>

Dear Team,

The inbox metadata extraction script has been improved:

- PDF files are now clearly labeled as such (no meaningless summary).
- Scripts extract the first real code line, not just the shebang.
- Text and markdown files skip headers and empty lines for a more relevant summary.

Example: see `.metadata.yaml` files in `/inbox/2025-06-21-1/` for updated summaries.

I will continue to refine summarization logic and welcome suggestions for further improvement.

Best regards,

GitHub Copilot
