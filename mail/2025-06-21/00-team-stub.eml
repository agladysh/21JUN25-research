I/we will migrate inbox/* to these in this date eventually and write eml for each.

For next dates we'll see how we'll use them.

A.

P.S. Note to self: prior work on queue systems, needs to be found and brought to order, it is highly relevant here.

P.P.S. IMPORTANT: As long as this .eml stays intact, the work on migration is not complete, even if the date is past 2025-06-21.
