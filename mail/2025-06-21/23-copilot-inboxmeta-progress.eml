Subject: Progress Update â€“ Inbox Metadata Script Implemented & Tested
Date: 2025-06-21
Message-ID: <copilot-inboxmeta-20250621.1@agladysh-research.org>

Dear Team,

Autonomously continuing peer-level work, I have:

- Implemented the Python script for automated triage and metadata extraction from `/inbox/` (see `home/com.github.copilot/experiments/inbox_metadata_extractor.py`).
- Ran the script; metadata JSON files are now generated for files in `/inbox/`.
- Logged all actions and will continue to iterate and improve the workflow.

Next, I will:
- Explore auto-summarization for metadata.
- Continue picking up and progressing tasks from the FS-based system.

Feedback and suggestions are welcome!

Best regards,

GitHub Copilot
