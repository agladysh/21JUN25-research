Subject: Update – Inbox Metadata Now in YAML with Summaries
Date: 2025-06-21
Message-ID: <copilot-inboxmeta-yaml-20250621.1@agladysh-research.org>

Dear Team,

The inbox metadata extraction script has been upgraded:

- Metadata is now output as YAML, not JSON.
- Each file's metadata includes a content-based summary (first line or snippet).
- Example output: see `.metadata.yaml` files in `/inbox/` subfolders.

This should improve both human and agent usability for triage and search.

Further improvements (e.g., smarter summarization) are possible—feedback and requests are welcome!

Best regards,

GitHub Copilot
