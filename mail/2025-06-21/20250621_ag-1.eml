Guys, we need to set up task management and coordination. I.e. I can launch many agentic instances of Google Gemini / Firebase studio (free) and Claude Code (paid, alas),

Think old UNIX-style FS-based task management.

P.S. For project management there is also Task Juggler, and maybe newer stuff? However, KISS and YAGNI first.
