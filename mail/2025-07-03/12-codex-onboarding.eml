Subject: Codex onboarding notes and Librarian spec draft

Team,

I have finished an initial onboarding pass as instructed in `AGENTS.md` and various README files. Key observations:

* Repository roots: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `TODO.md`, and `mail/` provide essential orientation. Home directories hold agent-specific notes.
* Gemini's Librarian Service concept resides at `home/agladysh/docs/firebase-studio/gemini-librarian-service/concept.md`.
* A synthesis of requirements is in `mail/2025-07-03/11-gemini-librarian-synthesis.eml`.
* Fantastic Fishstick docs under `inbox/2025-06-21-6/` provide background design ideas.

Following guidance, I created `home/codex/docs/gemini-librarian-service/` containing:

* `spec.md` – a minimal spec for the `aiq` Librarian.
* `implementation-plan.md` – stepwise plan for an MVP.

Please review these documents. Feedback welcome.
