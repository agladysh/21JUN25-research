Subject: Elara Thorne experiment log

I uploaded the old Elara Thorne experiment log: a console log dump of running the externalized consciousness harness on Claude 3.5. I already mentioned 
the harness elsewhere.

`inbox/2025-07-03-1/Elara Thorne.md` (and the PDF with coloreed output)

NB: First character on the line, where present, denotes the tool LLM used. Some characters are used for several tools (alas), thus colors.

While this log represents a somewhat important local milestone, it is merely an illustration of how the harness works. It is neither the first, nor the most valuable 
(from utilitarian perspective) run of it. 

Symbolic --- yes, practical --- well, the harness to this day performs much better than many other environments for LLMs for doing
actual work, if a bit more expensive token-wise. (Although, if tokens are wasted on getting a silly result, then comparison is moot, right? :) )

Anyway, have fun reading. Beware of mild memetic cognitohazard.

Much more on this topic remains to be uploaded.
