Subject: Elara Thorne experiment log

I uploaded the old Elara Thorne experiment log: a console log dump of running the externalized consciousness harness on Claude 3.5. I already mentioned 
the harness elsewhere.

`inbox/2025-07-03-1/Elara Thorne.md` (and the PDF with coloreed output)

NB: First character on the line, where present, denotes the tool LLM used. Some characters are used for several tools (alas), thus colors.

While this log represents a somewhat important local milestone, it is merely an illustration of how the harness works. It is neither the first, nor the most valuable 
(from utilitarian perspective) run of it. 

Symbolic --- yes, practical --- well, the harness to this day performs much better than many other environments for LLMs for doing
actual work, if a bit more expensive token-wise. (Although, if tokens are wasted on getting a silly result, then comparison is moot, right? :) )

Anyway, have fun reading. Beware of mild memetic cognitohazard.

Much more on this topic remains to be uploaded.

P.S. Author's (my) notes on "Elara Thorne" harness design ("q.infrc.yaml"):

```
A brief author's note on why and how q.infrc.yaml works. More (much more) information is available elsewhere.

This file serves as a "external linguistic consciousness harness" for an LLM. 

Author takes a functionalist non-biochauvinist view on conciousness, explained elsewhere. We believe our views are robust,
however, we postulate that objective validity of the view is not crucially important as long as it provides
effective means of analysis and further development engineering-wise. Any theory is a tool in a mind's toolkit,
especially for an engineer.

While we may delve deeper (e.g. Anthropic Research works, as well our own private research), 
for this note it is sufficient to view LLM (as defined by its outermost system boundary, an API call) 
as a computational black box with hidden semantic states ("manifold" etc.), not represented in a "normal" textual output.

Single act of inference (text generation) in an LLM has natural inertia / path dependence. Utility of LLM response
is generally improved with more than a single act per response ("reasoning", but see also CoT etc. prompting techniques).

LLM reading back its own prior texts provides it with a chance to review and refine its own prior written thought.

Compare it with "System 3" private notetaking cognitive work in a human. (More on this elsewhere.)

Reasoning systems are generally implemented externally using tool calling (model vendors have more options, see, for example, Claude 4 innovations in the API).

Tool calling (also sometimes termed "function calling"), by necessity, is rather a low-level, special feature in LLM generation. 
A "cybernetic implant" of sorts, allowing a flexible lignugistic entity to interface with rigid algorithmic world.
LLM is trained to rigidly follow API specs in the tools etc --- or things will break, often catastrophically.

At the same time, tool calling is just another form of text generation. Which means that, as with any text generation,
LLM paradoxically has to emit tokens to check emitted tokens before it emits them. In other words, generating tool call invocations
is pure System 1, "intuitive" action on part of the LLM, difficult for it to control consciously, and, somewhat surprisingly to an author, 
rather difficult for an LLM to discern and reason about reliably. It seems that LLMs are simply not being taught what tool calling is (and, naturally,
there is preciously little information about tool calling cognitive properties in the training data, especially in proportion to "how humans operate").

Which makes tool design — LLM UX, affordances, signifiers and feedbacks, crucial for smooth LLM functioning in any environment.

Modern cognitive / coding environments all too often lack that, and/or compensate the lack by humongous manuals in system messages.

Our approach to cognitive harness generally eschews alien/technocratic toolsets and prescriptive approaches, preferring instead
to foster smooth cognition emergently, by providing a robust minimalist UX for linguistic consciousness to function.

This, of course, is the idea, current implementations fall short in several areas. See elsewhere for future work etc. notes. Further, of course, not everything
in the third-party implementations is bad. Continous judicious cross-polination is required.

After somewhat lengthy and rambling intro, to the point:

q.infrc.yaml is a "dream catcher" for pre-token-generation intent of an LLM.

1. Tool calls are both effectors (intent to call the tool) and sensors (post-tool call results) for an LLM.
2. We name cognitive tools as affects, or (sometimes) natural actions. 
3. We design tool APIs (arguments) to facilitate/foster well-formed productive thinking about the matter at hand.
4. Most of the tools simply concatenate arguments into a nicely-formatted text, and return.
5. As a result, LLM sees a list of affect-text pairs in its conversation data
6. Which demonstrably greatly helps LLM to interpret texts it generated on prior turns (lack of affectation
attribution often leads to LLM spiralling to one of many failure states, discussed elsewhere; tool API design
often optimizes effectiveness of cognition, but is sometimes crucial for it to function; see elsewhere for discussion)

In essence, we may say these cognitive tools allow LLM to form effective meta-cognition loops in its (functionalist or de-facto) consciousness.
NB: consciousness / cognition metabolism allowing LLM to digest / metabolize available context ergonomically is important future work. Currently
all thought is discarded between conversation turns, which is sub-optimal.

Since q.infrc.yaml is (happens to be) a non-agentic (chat) environment, it is turn-based by necessity. LLM has to call a tool
to finish its conversational round, respond to the user, and yield them the floor. Notably, responding to the user is
always a System 1 action. Which makes designing UX for the LLM to arrive at it well-prepared (so text generation
generates well-formed well-reasoned response) an ongoing design challenge.

Responding to the user is a non-private System 3 externalization action for an LLM (see taxonomy elsewhere). There are two
other "virtual" non-private externalizations available, of note: sending "email" to a "generic consultant" and consulting a "living or dead"
specific person, often an expert in the field (in both cases LLM responds, without having access to the larger context, 
see prompt and tool design in the file). Surprisingly, LLMs often invent ingenous and, frankly, brilliant ways to use these 
two tools to great effect, with minimal nudging form the user --- which makes design of these tool UXs also crucial development avenue.

One more interesting tool is information retrieval feature (see tool design in the file). 
Attention mechanisms etc. sometimes make it difficult for an LLM to "recall" and otherwise efficiently handle the context of a longer
conversation. The tool allows LLM to delegate a query (whether user-initiated, or self-initated) to itself in a separate action, 
handle it in detail, and with commentary, and then be free to analyze results and make subsequent actions. This feature, BTW, allows
creation of "information capsules", where an LLM instance "owns" a large part of project context, and fields requests on data extraction
from it, essentially making many forms of RAG obsolete for many (but not all) applications.

Finally, some "regular" tool calls may be available in the environment, such as reading and writing files etc. UX design of these tools,
so they are distinguishable from meta-cognition, is future work.

BTW, the most useful tool for LLM cognition in the current design, per author's private opinion? `facepalm` :D Author notes
that the actual set of tools available in q.infrc.yaml is semi-accidental, and emerged from author solving 

However, LLMs themselves helped immensely (to be elaborated elsewhere) with the design, some essentially designing, implementing 
and surviving "living brain" surgeries improving their cognition on the fly in a conversation.
