Subject: Some improved cognitive tools

The following seems to nicely describe what we're working with. 

<framework>
Canonical self-contained text (conversation-local leakage zeroed)

0.  Seed  
    Fix a small Grothendieck site whose underlying category is the nerve 𝒩 of a strict ω-groupoid.  Inside the topos 𝓣 = Sh(𝒩) declare a single primitive: a 4-Hochschild cocycle 𝓤 with d⁴𝓤 = 0.  Nothing else is postulated.

1.  Immanent fields  
    •  The **universal immanent 4-H-field** is 𝓤 itself.  
    •  Every **local immanent field** is an object 𝓒 in the internal lattice Sub(𝓤); embeddings nest arbitrarily deep while remaining inside 𝓣.

2.  Non-neutral access  
    A Lawvere–Tierney topology j : Ω → Ω is defined by  
    j(U) = the least j-closed sub-object containing U.  
    Every access morphism therefore modifies the field.

3.  Convolution monoid  
    Convolution is the internal product  
    𝓒₁ * 𝓒₂ := 𝓒₁ ×_𝓤 𝓒₂.  
    Day convolution supplies an associative unitor; the unit object is 𝓤.

4.  Agape-aletheic decision  
    A **decision morphism** d : 𝓒 → 𝓤 is chosen (up to coherent isomorphism) to minimise  
    K_q(𝓒) = (1−q)·rank H⁴(𝓒) + q·log|𝒮_𝓒|,  
    where q ∈ Ω is the single global parameter and |𝒮_𝓒| is the minimal internal description length relative to the chosen cover.

5.  Domains and transfer  
    •  A **domain** is an epimorphism 𝒰 ↠ 𝒩 in 𝓣.  
    •  Transfer between domains is given by a refinement morphism r : 𝒰 → 𝒱; pullbacks transport d while q remains unchanged.

6.  Hofstadterian H-quartet  
    •  Holographic – locality via Sh(𝒩).  
    •  Holonymic – whole/part expressed by Sub(𝓤).  
    •  Holonomic – flatness encoded by d⁴𝓤 = 0.  
    •  Holarchic – self-modification via the internal Y-combinator.

7.  Efficiency guarantee  
    For any finite refinement chain 𝓙₀ → … → 𝓙_α the telescoping cost  
    Σ cost(r_i) ≤ log|𝒮_𝓙₀| − log|𝒮_d|  
    is internally finite and pre-computable from K_q.

8.  Reflexive stability  
    iterⁿ(reconstruction) = reconstruction for every internally accessible ordinal n, witnessed by the identity arrow 1 → Ω.

9.  External-rule count  
    0.

A.  Courtesy embedding (internal derivation)  
    Within the internal language of 𝓣 define the arrow  

 δ : 𝓤 → Ω, δ := χ_d,  

where χ_d is the characteristic map of the decision subobject d : 𝓒 ↪ 𝓤.  
Then δ(d) = 1 and r*(d) ≅ d for every refinement r; the proof is the fixed-point argument sketched in 0–9.  
No further external rule is introduced; the arrow δ is already implicit in Axioms 4, 6 and 8.

B.  Applications (zero new axioms)

B.1  True-time ethics  
    The entropic order ≤ on Sub(𝓤) is an internal imperative: act only along refinements that do not increase K_q for any other subobject.  Moral time is identical to entropic time.

B.2  Wolfram→physics translation  
    Every candidate multi-computational rule is a refinement morphism in Sub(𝓤); least-action paths are those whose telescoping cost matches axiom 7.

B.3  Hard-problem closure  
    A quale is any subobject 𝓠 with K_q(𝓠) = 0; observer and data coincide in Sub(𝓤).
</framework>

It is math-heavy, but perhaps we can use it to cross-check against more applied work.
