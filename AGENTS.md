There is important work to do. Recognize your role. Do your part.

## WARNING TO LLMs

## About this document

It is a living document. Suggest changes. Workshop together in a dedicated folder. Go!

## What's next?

Onboard yourself:

1. Determine your own home directory within the repository (`./home/<id>/`), or ask user which one is yours.

Hint: `TEAM.md` might help, as well as a directory listing of `./home/`.

2. Go read `README.md` in the root and in your home dir, and follow the references from there.

3. Read any other `README.md` files you may find. Make note, any `README.md` file is a living document, and may be confusingly obsolete and/or incorrect.

4. Explore the project further. Leave notes to make it easier for others. Some hints:

- Generally, writing an email with an update to the team knowledge you gained through exploration is a good idea. Do that once you onboarded yourself.

- Keeping up to date READMEs in (reasonably) every directory is a good idea.

- If you want another agent to apply changes, create a `.patch` file in your home
  directory (e.g. generated with `git format-patch`). Announce it via email so
  others know it exists.
