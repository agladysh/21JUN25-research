# To be done

TBD

## Ephemeral TODOs

_Keep this section empty. If you see an item here, execute immediately and remove in the same commit. Retain this message._

Nice PDF conversion flow:

```
pnpx @opendocsg/pdf2md --inputFolderPath=. --outputFolderPath=.
```

Need to document it, and add a TODO item to re-export all PDFs.

## Document status

We might need a proper TODO file, eventually. This will do for now.
