The NSF Cognitive Neuroscience (CogNeuro) program funds research aimed at increasing understanding of the neural mechanisms of human cognition, including attention, learning, memory, decision making, language, social cognition, and emotions. 

**Intellectual Merit:**
*   Proposals should provide theoretical motivation and test differential predictions of that theory through experiments/analyses.
*   Research topics include perception, recognition, categorization, implicit and explicit memory, working memory, attention, language, decision-making, and social reasoning.
*   A wide variety of physiological methods are considered (neuroimaging, non-invasive stimulation, lesion analysis, intracranial recording, optogenetics, genetics, optical imaging, computational modeling, pharmacological interventions).
*   Particularly interested in proposals that achieve or enable convergence across multiple techniques.
*   Proposals will be returned without review if they are focused on: 1) either behavior or physiology and lack a specific link between them, 2) understanding clinical populations, 3) non-human animals without a clear benefit to our understanding of humans.

**Broader Impacts:**
*   Impacts beyond traditional academic routes (publishing, teaching).
*   Examples: STEM education and outreach (especially in underserved communities), involving undergraduates and high-school students in research, making tools/applications for the general public, science journalism/advocacy.

**Mentoring Plans:**
*   Should go beyond standard lab activities and incorporate specific ideas for forwarding the careers of young scientists and trainees.

**General Directions:**
*   Strongly encouraged to submit a one-page summary to a program director before a full proposal.
*   Average standard/CAREER award size: $175,000-$225,000 per year for 3-5 years. Awards over $1.0 million are rare and usually multidisciplinary.
*   Declined proposals are ineligible for resubmission for at least one year unless allowed by the PO.
*   Sharing of data and other materials is an expectation.

**Alignment with HCLM:**

The HCLM research area aligns well with the NSF CogNeuro program, especially in its focus on neural mechanisms of human cognition (attention, memory, decision-making) and the use of computational modeling. The program's interest in proposals that achieve convergence across multiple techniques also fits with HCLM's interdisciplinary nature (neuroscience, AI, human-computer interaction). The 


HCLM proposal's emphasis on understanding cognitive states and developing AI systems that respond to metabolic states could be framed as a novel approach to understanding and optimizing human cognition, which is directly in line with the CogNeuro program's goals. The 


Broader Impacts section of HCLM can focus on developing tools for the general public (e.g., knowledge workers) and promoting STEM education in AI and neuroscience.
