### Summary of Funding Landscape Research

**1. National Science Foundation (NSF) - Cognitive Neuroscience (CogNeuro) Program:**
*   **Focus:** Understanding neural mechanisms of human cognition (attention, learning, memory, decision-making, language, social cognition, emotions).
*   **Relevance to HCLM:** Strong alignment with HCLM's focus on understanding cognitive states and optimizing human cognition through AI. The program encourages interdisciplinary approaches and convergence across multiple techniques, which fits HCLM's blend of theoretical computer science, neuroscience, and human-computer interaction.
*   **Funding:** Average standard/CAREER award size is $175,000-$225,000 per year for 3-5 years. Awards over $1.0 million are rare.
*   **Application Tip:** Strongly encourages submitting a one-page summary to a program director before a full proposal.

**2. Stanford Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute and Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) - AI and Neuroscience Partnership Grants:**
*   **Focus:** Projects that use AI to transform the understanding of the human brain and advance intelligent technology.
*   **Relevance to HCLM:** Direct alignment with HCLM's goal of integrating AI with neuroscience to understand and manage cognitive states. While specific calls may be closed, this partnership represents a relevant funding avenue for future applications.

**3. The Spencer Foundation - Initiative on AI and Education:**
*   **Focus:** Research on AI, education, and learning that supports equitable educational use, development, and understanding of AI technologies.
*   **Relevance to HCLM:** While not directly focused on neuroscience, the HCLM's potential application in optimizing learning and productivity for knowledge workers could be framed within the context of education and human performance, making this a potential, albeit less direct, funding source.

**4. NSF - National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Research Institutes:**
*   **Focus:** Large-scale, multi-institutional research on AI.
*   **Relevance to HCLM:** This is a broader program, but if the HCLM research can be scaled to a larger, collaborative effort, it could fit within the scope of an AI Research Institute. These grants are typically substantial.
*   **Funding:** Average total size and duration of a grant is $4M per year for 5 years.

**Overall Funding Strategy for HCLM:**

The most promising avenues for HCLM research funding appear to be directly within neuroscience and AI programs that emphasize interdisciplinary approaches and computational modeling of cognitive functions. The NSF Cognitive Neuroscience program and Stanford's AI and Neuroscience Grants are excellent fits. For larger-scale funding, the NSF AI Research Institutes could be a target if a collaborative project can be formed. Framing the research within the context of human performance optimization and well-being will be crucial for all applications.

**Next Steps:**

Based on this research, the next phase will involve crafting a compelling research proposal/white paper that highlights the novelty and significance of Holographic Cognitive Load Management (HCLM), tailored to the priorities of these funding bodies.
