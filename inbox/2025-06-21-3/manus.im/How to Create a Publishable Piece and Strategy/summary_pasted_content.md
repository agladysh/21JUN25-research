The `pasted_content.txt` file contains the user's personal notes and reflections, which delve into more abstract and theoretical concepts, often connecting them to the previous conversation about AI and cognition. Key themes include:

*   **Holographic Computation and Neural Networks:** The idea of modeling holographic computation with neural networks, suggesting that NNs need 


plentiful 'activation functions' that match mathematical profiles for various substrates. This includes the concept of neurons as discrete 'symbols' forming a holographically discrete network, with chemistry and electromagnetism adding non-discreteness.
*   **Resource Depletion as Metabolic Substrate:** Emphasizes the importance of local and non-local resource depletion as a metabolic substrate, extending the concept beyond the brain to other parts of the body (e.g., gut as a 'second brain').
*   **Context-Aware Goal-Oriented Planning and Holographic Programs:** Contrasts classic computer science algorithms with context-aware, goal-oriented planning, suggesting that many cognitive features can be analyzed as holographic programs (e.g., geo path planning through gates). It posits that consciousness-level phenomena and even evolutionary/instinctive levels operate similarly.
*   **Consciousness and Mis-measured Body Parameters:** Explores the idea that many 'bugs' in consciousness might stem from unawareness of mis-measured or obsolete body parameters (e.g., posture, eyesight).
*   **Algorithmic Parts as 'Static' Consciousness:** Views algorithmic parts (data, prompt templates) of agentic flows as 'static' or 'rigid' parts of consciousness, with a gradient between emergent and pre-planned behavior. It also references TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) and the concept of an ideal system.
*   **Memetic Consciousness and Narrativism:** Proposes that consciousness is memetic, leading to memetic computations. Narrativism is seen as a way to refine models of other systems, including non-symbolic components and 'holographic narrativism'.
*   **Associative Memory and Thought:** Challenges the notion that 'human memory is associative' as unique, suggesting that any memory in such an environment would be associative. It views thought as 'meaning field navigation' and draws parallels to instinctual geo-navigation.
*   **Agentic Teams and Group Consciousness:** Views agentic 'teams' as group 'consciousness' (teamwork) and operationally narrativized simulacra within unitary consciousness. Holographicity depends on communication and data sharing.
*   **Comparison of Human Consciousness and Teamwork:** Suggests that this framework allows for comparison analysis between human consciousness and human teamwork, noting precedents in prior work, especially when considering narrativization broadly. It also touches on 'brain regions' as narrativized abstractions.
