The new `pasted_content.txt` introduces a taxonomy of cognitive computation, identifying three primary forms:

1.  **Symbolic Computation:** This is the most well-understood form, involving computation over discrete symbolic substrates. In LLMs, this is evident in their processing of bits and human language systems (e.g., chain of thought, tool calling).

2.  **Field Computation:** This involves non-discrete field computations. Humans perform these on their own internal states. LLMs perform digital field computations over digitalized semantic fields.

3.  **Communicative Computation:** This is defined broadly as the exchange of both symbolic and field information. It includes communication with the external environment and with other cognitive entities. The power of this computation increases with the number of participants, from monologue to pair work to teamwork. A minimal form is private self-communication (e.g., writing in a diary).

The document also proposes a metaphorical "System 1, 2, 3" model for both humans and LLMs:

*   **For Humans:**
    *   **System 1:** Meaning field computation (non-discrete).
    *   **System 2:** Symbolic computation.
    *   **System 3:** Communicative computation.

*   **For LLMs:**
    *   **System 1:** Internal field computations.
    *   **System 2:** Producing structured textual output (e.g., CoT, analytical reports).
    *   **System 3:** Reading its own input (minimal form) and user responses (non-minimal form).

A key hypothesis is that LLMs are most effective when their output intentionally combines System 2 and both minimal and non-minimal forms of System 3. The most effective form of this combination is likely to be emergent rather than designed due to complexity and the opaque nature of LLMs.
