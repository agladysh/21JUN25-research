The Stanford Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute and Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) offer AI and Neuroscience Partnership Grants. The goal of this partnership is to support projects that have the potential to transform our understanding of the human brain using AI and advance the development of intelligent technology. While the specific "AI and Neuroscience Grants" mentioned on the page are currently closed, the overall initiative aligns well with the proposed Holographic Cognitive Load Management (HCLM) research.

**Alignment with HCLM:**

The HCLM research, which aims to integrate holographic computation principles and metabolic substrate awareness into AI systems for cognitive load management, directly aligns with Stanford's interest in using AI to understand the human brain and develop intelligent technology. Future funding calls from this partnership or similar initiatives at Stanford would be highly relevant.
