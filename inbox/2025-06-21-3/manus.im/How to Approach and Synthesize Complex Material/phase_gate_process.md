# Phase-Gate Process for Background File Integration

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Analyze background.sh file (prior work) and integrate with recent theoretical development while maintaining precise attribution and extracting forgotten insights through resonance analysis.

**Complexity**: High - 994 lines of conversation data with potential LLM confusion, timeline attribution challenges, and need for precise integration with extensive recent theoretical work.

**Approach**: Waterfall process with bidirectional transition loops and phase-gate controls to prevent premature termination.
