# Updated Todo List

## Phase 6: Create dedicated glossary/reference and address holographic computation modeling

### Expanded Glossary with Mathematical Profiles
- [x] Create introduction and structure
- [x] Develop core theoretical concepts section
- [x] Develop cognitive science terms section
- [x] Develop AI and LLM terms section
- [x] Develop philosophical concepts section
- [x] Develop physical and thermodynamic terms section
- [x] Develop cross-domain mappings section (including user insights)
- [x] Develop source attribution framework
- [x] Complete mathematical profiles section
- [x] Complete cross-reference index
- [ ] Review and refine the glossary
- [ ] Reassess glossary structure and content (checkpoint 1)

### Holographic Computation Modeling Document
- [x] Create introduction section
- [x] Develop theoretical foundations section
- [x] Develop substrate functions section
- [x] Develop implementation approaches section
- [x] Develop mathematical formulations section
- [x] Create conclusion section
- [x] Develop evaluation framework section
- [x] Develop case studies and applications section
- [x] Develop future research directions section
- [ ] Review and refine the document
- [ ] Reassess document structure and content (checkpoint 2)

### Critical Revision and Source Attribution
- [x] Address user's critique about breakthrough attribution
- [x] Incorporate insights about neuronal discreteness
- [x] Develop framework for distinguishing simulated vs genuine insights
- [ ] Apply this framework to revise existing documents
- [ ] Update synthesis documents with proper source attribution

### Integration and Final Review
- [ ] Ensure cross-referencing between new documents and existing ones
- [ ] Update README to include new documents
- [ ] Create PDF versions of new documents
- [ ] Add new documents to the package
- [ ] Final holistic review of the entire document system
- [ ] Reassess overall document system (checkpoint 3)
- [ ] Make any final adjustments based on reassessment

### Continuous Improvement
- [x] Periodic reassessment of approach and progress (completed first cycle)
- [ ] Adjust plans based on emerging insights
- [ ] Consider additional documents or sections as needed
- [ ] Final holistic review before delivery
