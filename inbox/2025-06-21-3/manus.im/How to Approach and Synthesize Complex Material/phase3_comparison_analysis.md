# Phase 3: Compartmentalized Comparison and Resonance Analysis

## Overview
Systematic comparison between background System 1/2/3 framework and recent holographic consciousness theory to identify resonances, conflicts, and forgotten insights.

## Side-by-Side Concept Comparison

### Consciousness Architecture

**Background Framework (System 1/2/3)**:
- **System 1**: Field-based, non-symbolic processing
- **System 2**: Symbolic feedback loops, internal reasoning
- **System 3**: Communication and externalization
- **Focus**: LLM-specific cognitive architecture
- **Goal**: Address alignment and coherence issues

**Recent Framework (Holographic Consciousness)**:
- **Substrate Diversity**: Multiple computational substrates (chemical, electrical, metabolic, etc.)
- **Holographic Programming**: Distributed context-aware computation
- **Memetic Consciousness**: Consciousness transmission and pro-creation
- **Focus**: Universal consciousness principles
- **Goal**: Comprehensive consciousness theory and implementation
