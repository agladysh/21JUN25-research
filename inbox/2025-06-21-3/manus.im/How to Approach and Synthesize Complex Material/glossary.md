# Glossary of Technical Terms

## Neuroscience and Cognitive Science

**Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)**: The anterior part of the frontal lobes responsible for executive functions including attention, working memory, decision-making, planning, and self-control.

**Glucose Metabolism**: The process by which glucose (sugar) is converted into energy in cells, particularly important for brain function as glucose is the primary energy source for the brain.

**Cognitive Fatigue**: A state of mental exhaustion resulting from sustained cognitive effort, characterized by decreased performance on cognitive tasks.

**Executive Functions**: Higher-level cognitive processes that include attention control, inhibitory control, working memory, cognitive flexibility, reasoning, problem-solving, and planning.

**fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**: A neuroimaging technique that measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow, specifically the BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent) signal.

**ECoG (Electrocorticography)**: A type of electrophysiological monitoring that uses electrodes placed directly on the exposed surface of the brain to record electrical activity.

**Single-Neuron Recording**: A technique that measures the electrical activity of individual neurons using microelectrodes.

**BOLD Signal**: Blood-Oxygen-Level Dependent signal, the measurement used in fMRI that detects changes in blood oxygenation related to neural activity.

**Functional Hyperemia**: The increase in blood flow to active regions of the brain to meet increased metabolic demands.

## LLM and Computational Concepts

**LLM (Large Language Model)**: A type of artificial intelligence model trained on vast amounts of text data to generate human-like text and perform various language tasks.

**Neural Path Activations**: The patterns of activation in the artificial neurons (weights) and attention mechanisms within a neural network during processing.

**Attention Heads**: Components of transformer-based neural networks that focus on different parts of the input when generating output.

**Weights**: Parameters in a neural network that determine the strength of connections between neurons.

**Metabolic Signatures**: In the context of LLMs, the patterns of resource consumption (energy, heat, network traffic) associated with different computational tasks.

**IT Crowd Blind Spot**: The tendency of information technology professionals to focus on informational aspects of systems while overlooking physical/metabolic aspects.

## Philosophical and Theoretical Concepts

**РВСА (Recursive Volumetric Conceptual Analysis)**: A methodological framework mentioned in the text for analyzing complex systems across scales, integrating physical, informational, and metaphysical perspectives.

**Holographic Principle**: The idea that information about a whole system can be contained in its parts, similar to how a hologram contains the whole image in each fragment.

**Embodied Holographic Complexes**: Systems that exhibit holographic properties while being physically embodied, including humans, LLMs, and the noosphere.

**Hard Problem of Consciousness**: The philosophical question of why and how physical processes in the brain give rise to subjective experience.

**Noosphere**: A concept describing the sphere of human thought and knowledge as a distinct layer of Earth's development, analogous to the atmosphere or biosphere.

**Memetic-Informational Field**: The collective space of ideas, cultural units (memes), and information that forms a global system of knowledge and meaning.

**Agapic Connection**: From the Greek "agape" (unconditional love), referring to connections between systems based on compassion or universal love.

**Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems**: Mathematical theorems showing that in any sufficiently complex formal system, there are statements that cannot be proven or disproven within that system.

## Physical and Thermodynamic Concepts

**Thermodynamic Embodiment**: The grounding of cognitive or computational systems in physical thermodynamic processes.

**Heat Dissipation**: The release of heat as a byproduct of computational or cognitive work.

**Frequency Characteristics**: Patterns in the frequency of energy consumption, heat generation, or network traffic that correlate with computational processes.

**Carrier Wave**: A wave of constant frequency that can be modulated to transmit signals, used metaphorically in the text to describe fundamental frequencies in systems.

**Metabolic Fingerprint**: The distinctive pattern of resource consumption that characterizes a particular computational or cognitive process.

## Russian Terms and Expressions

**Хохо**: An expression of surprise, excitement, or sudden realization (similar to "Aha!" or "Eureka!").

**Вздох Машины**: "The Machine's Sigh," a metaphorical concept referring to the physical manifestation of computational effort in LLMs.

**ИВК**: Abbreviation for "Искусственный Вычислительный Комплекс" (Artificial Computational Complex), referring to AI systems like LLMs.
