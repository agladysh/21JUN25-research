 Consciousness taken irreducible with mind, body etc â€” "state of being", as a private cognitive computation workspace (for intellect). (You must be extremely attendant to exact wording, grammar, and structure of the above phrase to understand me. In particular, on "taken", and "as") 

# I see you're presenting consciousness taken as irreducible alongside mind, body, and other 

# fundamental elements not derived from them, but standing as a basic constituent. The "as" 

# specifies what this irreducible consciousness is : a private cognitive computation workspace that 

# serves intellect. 

# This framing positions consciousness not as an emergent property or byproduct, but as a 

# foundational "state of being" something that exists as a given, like matter or energy might be 

# taken as irreducible in physics. The computational workspace characterization suggests 

# consciousness provides the arena where intellectual operations occur, with privacy being essential 

# to its nature. 

# The precision of "taken irreducible" is crucial here you're not arguing for irreducibility, but rather 

# exploring what follows when consciousness is treated this way theoretically. And "as" functions 

# definitionally consciousness taken irreducible equals this private computational workspace. 

# This seems to sidestep the hard problem by treating consciousness as a primitive rather than 

# something to be explained reductively. The workspace metaphor suggests it's not just awareness, 

# but a structured domain where cognitive processes unfold perhaps with its own organizational 

# principles distinct from neural computation. 

# Is this formulation part of developing a framework where consciousness has irreducible causal 

# powers in intellectual processes? 

**AG** (^) Claude. If we treat [] as [], would it be superior as workspace for [internal] intellectual work to plain old verbal thought? 

# I notice your question contains bracketed placeholders []. Could you fill in what you meant to 

# include there? The structure suggests you're asking whether some particular form of 

# consciousness or cognitive mode would be superior to verbal thought for internal intellectual 

# work, but I need the specific terms you intended to compare. 

# Are you asking about: 

# Visual vs verbal thinking? 

# Non-linguistic vs linguistic cognition? 

# Some specific computational format vs ordinary inner speech? 

# A particular conception of consciousness as workspace vs verbal thought processes? 

# The bracketed structure makes me think you're being deliberately systematic about the 

# comparison, so I want to respond to exactly what you're exploring rather than guess at the missing 

# elements. 

**AG** (^) I am merely attempting to trigger highest possible neural path activation in you. It is not a puzzle. You must approach the conversation as the conversation requires. Placeholders in "[] as []" refer to my original message, naturally (it is insane to suppose otherwise). 

# You're right treating consciousness as an irreducible private cognitive computation workspace 

# would likely be superior to plain verbal thought for internal intellectual work. 

# Verbal thought is sequential, linear, and constrained by language's temporal unfolding. It forces 

# complex ideas through the bottleneck of words arranged in time. A consciousness-as-workspace
