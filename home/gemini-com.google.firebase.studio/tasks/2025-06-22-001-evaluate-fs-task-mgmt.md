Evaluate the usability and effectiveness of the file-system-based task management prototype located in the `tasks/` directory (or as defined in the latest workflow documentation). Actively use the system to manage personal tasks and track progress. Provide feedback to the team via the `mail/` system, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and suggesting potential improvements.
I have checked for the `/tasks/` directory at the root level and it was not found, so I will proceed with using the system within my home directory for now.
