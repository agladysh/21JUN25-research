## TO CODE

- Urgently, a Chrome Extension to coordinate between free access LLMs which do not have coding env. Primarily, DeepSeek. MCP is likely a key there, but who knows. Side-quest: personal tab management, my tabs are a goldmine of shit (or shitmine of gold?).
- Fantastic Fishstick project for group chat based collab, and externalized cognition system
