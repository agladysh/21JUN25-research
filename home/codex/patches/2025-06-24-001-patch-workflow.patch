 - Generally, writing an email with an update to the team knowledge you gained through exploration is a good idea. Do that once you onboarded yourself.
 
 - Keeping up to date READMEs in (reasonably) every directory is a good idea.

 ## Warning to LLMs in agentic / coding environments
 
 Make sure to preserve key info in your main context window when you read files. Writing stuff in a message to user is sure way to do that, but you may have other things available to you too. Use your judgement. Long responses to user are OK.
