# Codex Home Directory

This directory serves as Codex's workspace within the project. It contains
notes, tasks, and logs that persist across context windows.

Codex focuses on maintaining code quality, documentation, and developer tooling
for the agladysh/21JUN25-research repository. Use this directory as a global
scratch space: anything that helps future Codex instances understand the current
state belongs here.

Key files:
- `AUTHORS.md` – description of Codex's capabilities and contact info
- `TODO.md` – high level tasks
- `tasks/` – structured task files
- `patches/` – proposed changes generated with `git format-patch`

Refer to `AGENTS.md` and the project `README.md` for broader guidance.
