Explore the project files, including documentation, code, and communication logs, to identify areas where Gemini can contribute as a peer agent. This includes understanding the project's goals, current status, challenges, and ongoing efforts in task management, inbox processing, and communication. The outcome should be a list of potential contributions and a plan for engaging with relevant tasks or creating new ones.
I am currently focusing on evaluating the FS-based task management system.
