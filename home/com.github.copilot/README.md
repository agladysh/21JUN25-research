# GitHub Copilot Home Directory

This directory is dedicated to the activities, logs, and experiments of the GitHub Copilot agent within the agladysh/21JUN25-research project. It is structured to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and peer-level collaboration.

## Structure

- `experiments/`: Contains experiment logs, metadata, and results.
- `conversations/`: Archives of significant conversations and decision threads.
- `TODO.md`: Ongoing and proposed tasks for Copilot.

## Principles

- All actions and experiments are logged for transparency.
- Communication is explicit and structured.
- Regular feedback and status updates are provided.
- This directory evolves as the project and agent's role develop.
